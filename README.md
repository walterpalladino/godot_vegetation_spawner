# Godot Vegetation Spawner

There are two versions, one using MultiMeshInstance3D and the other for standard meshes

## Spawner for MeshInstance3D

This version is the one which I intend to mantain and improve because allow several optimizations.


## Spawner for MultiMeshInstance3D

Attached to any MMI you can add with a click meshes. You can use it to create multiple layers.
Probably will not be updated because there are some drawbacks related to the
MultiMeshInstance3D optimization.

## Features

- Choose a Mesh per MMI
- Change default Material
- Randomize size and rotation for every instance
